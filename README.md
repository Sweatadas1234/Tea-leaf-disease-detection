# Tea Leaf Disease Detection Using ML/DL

## Project Overview:
- Early and accurate detection of diseases affecting tea plants using **AI and ML**.
- Helps farmers quickly identify tea leaf diseases, improving crop quality and yield.

## Problem:
- Tea plants face various diseases that harm production.
- Traditional disease detection methods are time-consuming and error-prone.

## Objectives:
- Use **image processing** to detect disease symptoms on tea leaves.
- Compare four models (**VGG16**, **ResNet**, **SSD**, **Faster R-CNN**) for the best accuracy.
- Automate detection to reduce human effort and improve timeliness.
- Extract features to identify healthy and diseased parts of the leaves.
- Train models for higher accuracy and reliability.

## Scope:
1. Disease identification via **image processing** and **machine learning**.
2. Real-time detection for improved crop protection.

## Outcome:
- A tool to help tea growers with accurate, real-time disease detection using **AI** and **deep learning** techniques.
