**Tea Leaf Disease Detection Using ML/DL**

Project Overview:

1. Early and accurate detection of diseases affecting tea plants using AI and ML.
2. Helps farmers quickly identify tea leaf diseases, improving crop quality and yield.
   
Problem:

1. Tea plants face various diseases that harm production.
2. Traditional disease detection methods are time-consuming and error-prone.
   
Objectives:
1. Use image processing to detect disease symptoms on tea leaves.
2. Compare four models (VGG16, ResNet, SSD, Faster R-CNN) for the best accuracy.
3. Automate detection to reduce human effort and improve timeliness.
4. Extract features to identify healthy and diseased parts of the leaves.
5. Train models for higher accuracy and reliability.
   
Scope:
1. Disease identification via image processing and machine learning.
2.Real-time detection for improved crop protection.

Outcome:

A tool to help tea growers with accurate, real-time disease detection using AI and deep learning techniques.
